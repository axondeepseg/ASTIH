# 🧠 ASTIH: Axon Segmentation Training Initiative for Histology
The Axon Segmentation Training Initiative for Histology (ASTIH) is a growing collection of publicly available datasets for axon and myelin segmentation in histology images. This initiative aims to foster the development of robust and generalizable deep learning models applicable across diverse biological contexts and imaging techniques. By providing a wide range of data spanning multiple species, microscopy modalities, and resolutions, ASTIH seeks to bridge the gap between fundamental research and translational applications in neuroscience and pathology. We are committed to continuously maintain and expand this collection with new datasets in the future.
